//! MVP IO event loop (docs/design-decisions.md §6) — shared by the JIT
//! (`cantor run`, main.rs) and AOT (`cantor build`, `src/codegen/aot.rs`)
//! backends. Only `drive_event_loop` differs between the two call sites:
//! JIT resolves `seed`/`step` via an `ExecutionEngine` lookup, AOT gets
//! them as ordinary statically-linked `extern "C"` function pointers — the
//! loop body itself, and every value encode/decode helper below, is
//! identical either way.
